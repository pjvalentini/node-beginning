# Reference Notes: Solving Programming Problems

---

# Error messages
- Read the error message. Error messages were designed by developers to help you.
- The first line tells you the nature of the error.
- The second line tells you the file where the error occurred and the line number.

---

# Narrowing down the problem
- Finding the exact source of the problem is most of the work.
- If your code is organized so that each block does one specific thing, when something breaks, the first place you should look is the code that's responsible for that functionality. Practice will give you experience writing code that's easy to fix.
- Look at the values of various objects to confirm that they are what you think they are.
- Confirm where the error is by replacing the offending code with something trivial that you know won't break.
---

# Proper googling
- http://stackoverflow.com/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ are the two most important sites you'll come across.
- Most problems are not unique. Search the internet for answers if you're lost.
- Learning which search terms to use is a difficult skill that takes awhile to learn. Choose keywords that describe your problem without constraining it to things that couldn't possibly apply to anyone else.
- A lazy programmer will find some code that fixes their issue and blindly copy and paste the answer into their code.
- A good programmer will take the time to understand the nature of their issue, improving themselves and saving time in the long run.

# Solving your problem
- Trial and error rarely works, even in the simplest of cases.
- Decide what you want the code to do, then research your issue until you find a way forward.
- Break down your problem into the smallest possible parts.
- Learn how to communicate your intentions in a spoken language. This is critical to finding gaps in your expectations of what you thing is going to happen.

# Self sufficiency is the goal
- Ultimately, you may have to ask for help. This is perfectly okay! We're in a classroom environment.
- Understand that this support will not be available after you graduate. Learn to solve problems on your own.
- Being handed answers, especially in the beginning, will hamstring your ability to learn, and you'll fall behind. Put in the extra hours to learn things on your own.
