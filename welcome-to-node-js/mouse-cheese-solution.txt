| 5 cheeses! |
+------------+

3 groups of 3 each get a wheel
the fastest group contains the special mouse **or** the special mouse is in the remaining 3

of the pool of 3, give 2 mice a wheel each. the faster of the two is the special mouse, or the third mouse is the fastest one

concepts:
if n mice finish their cheeses at the same time, the special mouse is in the pool that wasnâ€™t eating anything
evenly divided groups of mice will indicate whether the special mouse is in a particular group
