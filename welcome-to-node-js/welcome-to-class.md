# On Timing
​
*Be on time*
Being on time is key to your success! Being early to work on things with your classmates before class begins is even better
​
*Stay late*
Make this 3 months count. Don't be afraid to stay in the office until 21 or 22 working on problems with your classmates - that's why there's a cafe!
